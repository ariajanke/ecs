Personal Common/Utility Library
===============================

This library is needed by multiple projects. I've reduced the code size as much as possible. <br />
So far two project depends on this library:
+ ksg or "Kip's SFML GUI" library
+ tmap or My "TiledMap" rendering/parsing library
Both of these projects are further dependant on SFML, as is this one (for DrawRectangle).

Tests
=====

Tests will cover non-trivial utility functions. A trivial function here is a function without edge cases, loops, or branches.

License
=======
I'm thinking of relaxing copyright here, since most of this stuff is trivial. Further I may go so far as to release other works in a more permissible license.
